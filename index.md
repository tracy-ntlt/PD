üè≠ Sample Execution Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
The vendor can not catch the schedule as they committed (1 time)	The vendor can not catch the schedule as they committed (2-3 times)	Vendor complete samples but at the time of launching becomes over capacity or bad quality
Finishing is not good ‚Üí wash up ‚Üí Delay the sample process (1 time)	Finishing is not good ‚Üí wash up ‚Üí Delay the sample process (2-3 times)	Samples shipped to wrong WHS
Veneer lamination issue when we have the first WW review	White wood material can not achieve finish per design's intention	
Chair seat comfort issue because of seat construction and not follow foam standard	Market sample material can not produce on production (Ex: French OAK veneer of B985); Vendor can not select veneer and do finishing same with samples but samples already showed and have an order, price is approved	
The veneer has glue exposed on the surface	Vendor is unable to continue completing sample due to different reasons	
Drawer function, Misalignment of drawer gap between front door panel and frame	The vendor can not catch the schedule and cause the delay on the sample	
Sample missed radius	Develop new sample which close to market show - rush sample	
Glide didn't attach at center of the drawer box as standard	Sample speed is too slow to meet expectation/shipping plan	
Inconsistent finish and hardware color between bedroom, dining... from different vendor sampling		
Record sample doesn't match market sample		
The drawer front panel was warped ‚Üí improve by increasing the thickness of panel/veneer ‚Üí impact to the price		
The size of product causes some waste on material, not utilize the usage on material		

üìê Technical Drawing & Design Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Drawing issues (not include Cube Calculation; different with inline, different dimension in 3 views...)		Eng alignment about on going project

üì¶ Cube & Space Optimization Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Some original designs don't create a better cube arrangement	Cube is changeable before/after market because construction changes or adding more wood block; Cube is changeable even when using the calculation formula from Engineering Team	Price is too high but don't have vendors to have capability to compete

üìã Documentation & Compliance Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Electronic component: Sample stuck on document for air shipment. Nearly missed last pick up late ‚Üí asked leader to support on this time	No vendor capability to execute a design
New electric component needs UL, vendor inform will submit UL if they are informed that component get order	

üöö Material Coordination & Supply Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Long sample process due to using new materials	New fabric hold by customs that cause delaying sample process	
Can't find vendor to make high level outdoor sample	

ü§ù Vendor Collaboration Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Vendor doesn't follow up the drawing to mock up the sample to cause delay		
Sample review comment rejected by vendor's management and doesn't inform us to cause delay		
Other vendors should follow inline requirements to develop sample but not follow (refinish/recover in different vendor side)		
No feedback from vendors once send out info, need to push them		

üí∞ Pricing Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Submitted sample price is higher than target in different %	Vendor made mistake in pricing and we used it for market	
New vendor quotation is different with market sample	Price is changeable for re-finish sample. Inline production just re-finish with new standard like: honey-comb, packing method, construction ‚áí how to maintain the price or need exceptional	
Evaluate vendors to quote, which can handle that group for production	

üì∏ Photography & Documentation Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Studio photos don't show enough details on samples		

üö¢ Shipment & Logistics Issues


Low Risk	Medium Risk	High Risk
Sample arrived market but missing hardware/component/broken piece	
Some issues affect shipment deadline, out of fabric, damage on sample, color inconsistent
